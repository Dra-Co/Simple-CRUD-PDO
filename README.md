# Simple-CRUD-PDO
Simple CRUD program (HTML, Bootstrap 5, PHP, PDO Connection)

Features :
- Create data
- Read data
- Update data
- Delete data
- Multi-functional form (Update and Delete in one form)
- Error Handling

Note :
-
In this case, I used id with auto-increment for the primary key. Therefore, the user doesn't need to fill in the primary key anymore.
To prevent the database from SQL Injection, I used bindValue() function.
This is a simple CRUD program, so feel free to customize the program.
